<div class="panel">
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGH8nxRt6YUMj5PTMas0NWusGb74gqLkQ4BUTCBtxiA/edit" target="blank"><img src = "https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Docs.max-1100x1100.png" width="150px"></a>
  <p > This document contains my active cover letter. Here is the <a style="color: blue;" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGH8nxRt6YUMj5PTMas0NWusGb74gqLkQ4BUTCBtxiA/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">link </a>to my document.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">2: Curriculum Vitae= Resume (Final Version include responsive design & Print media Query</button>
<div class="panel">
  <a href="assets/resume_final/zhi_res4index.html" target="blank"><img src = "assets/images/zhi_finresume.png" width="250px"></a>
  <p>This is the final version of my resume. I liked the original colors, but decided that implementing a banner with another color would be better, and that was the major adjustment that I made. I also modified the print media query to account for these new changes. The website should be fairly responsive as well. Here is the <a style="color: blue;" href="assets/resume_final/zhi_res4index.html" target="blank">link </a>to my final website.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">3: Element Presentation</button>
<div class="panel">
  <a href="assets/tags_project/zhi_elem_pres/html/zhi_ElemPres_index.html" target="blank"><img src = "assets/images/zhi_elements.png" width="250px"></a>
  <p > The Element Presentation was an assignment early on into the year, and one of our first major projects. The two elements I chose to do my presentation on were Maps and Tables. Here is the <a style="color: blue;" href="assets/tags_project/zhi_elem_pres/html/zhi_ElemPres_index.html" target="blank">link </a>to my presentation.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">4: Favorite Website Screenshot</button>
<div class="panel">
  <a href="assets/images/favwebsc.png" target="blank"><img src = "assets/images/favwebsc.png" width="330px" height="200px;"></a>
  <p> For my favorite website, I chose the new Facebook website, as I liked the improvement that they made from the classic Facebook website. A screenshot of this website is shown on the left (click the image to open in new tab)</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">5: Recreate of Fav Website  </button>
<div class="panel">
  <a href="assets/facebookcopy/html/zhi_webrecreation_index.html" target="blank"><img src = "assets/images/zhi_recreate.png" width="330px"></a>
  <p > The purpose of this assignment was to recreate the original website as closely as possible. Since I chose facebook, there were many dropdowns div elements and outside links that I had to incorporate into my webpage. Here is a <a style="color: blue;" href="assets/facebookcopy/html/zhi_webrecreation_index.html" target="blank">link </a>to my recreate website.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">6: Re-Design of Fav website  </button>
<div class="panel">
  <a href="https://webredesign.herokuapp.com/html/zhi_index.php" target="blank"><img src = "assets/images/zhi_redesign.png" width="330px"></a>
  <p > To improve, and redesign, the current facebook website, I decided to maintain the minimalistic style. However, I added my own touch on it by employing a winter theme as seen with the snow and skis in the registration page. Here is the <a style="color: blue;" href="https://webredesign.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">link </a>to my redesign.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">7: Box Model Wireframe of Favorite Website  </button>
<div class="panel">
  <a href="assets/images/Zhi_wireframe.png" target="blank"><img src = "assets/images/Zhi_wireframe.png" width="330px" height="200px;"></a>
  <p>In order to break down the different components of the facebook website, I first created a box model before I started coding. This allowed me to plan out my divs and structure and it expedited the coding process. An image of my box model is shown on the left (click the image to open in new tab)</p></p>

  <p > This assignment was a brief project that allowed us to use animations in a creative way. While reading through w3 schools, their animations reminded me of horse races in arcades, as the horses there moved from left to right. I implemented this in a website which can be seen in this <a style="color: blue;" href="assets/animationpractice/zhi_animation_index.html" target="blank">link </a>.</p>

It now includes a print media query to help format the page when the user tries to print it. My original design was already quite print friendly and there was not too much that I had to change.</p>
