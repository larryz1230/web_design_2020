I was introduced to the sport when I was around 8 or 9 years old, and would play frequently on the weekends with some of my friends. In my freshman year and sophmore year, I made the jv team at school, and I hoped to play for varsity this year. However, with the soccer season delayed for now, I have spent more time watching my favorite professional team, Chelsea F.C, play."  name="soccer">

Pasta, and almost all Italian food, is just so good. I cannot really explain why I like it, I just do. Of course, pasta is not the only food that I enjoy. I grew up eating traditional Chinese foods, such as rice and dumplings, and I have grown accustomed to them over time. I also enjoy other Asian foods, such as Korean and Japanese cuisine.

While I have not spent much time on web development, I think that it is pretty interesting. This project has provided me with more expereince in front-end development, and I hope to become familiar with backend languages such as php sometime in the future as well." name="coding">
